# Planning_Final_Project
This is the repo for the planning final project on socially compliant autonomous vehicles.

Download CARLA on your local machine first.

Download the AdditionalMaps from here(https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases), since we're using Town06.
Put the zip file in to the "Import" folder, then run "./ImportAssets.sh" to import the maps.

Start the simulator by running /opt/carla-simulator/bin/CarlaUE4.sh

To verify CARLA setup, run "simple_test.py" in lane_change with
$ python simple_test.py
